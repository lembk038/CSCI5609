-  Install three.js by runing
   ```
   npm i -S three
   npm i --save-dev @types/three
   ```
- Put the provided `3d` folder into your `static` folder. This folder contains 3D models and texture images we will use in this assignment.

- As always, copy and paste the content of `A3.svelte` into your `src/routes/A3/+page.svelte` file.

With `npm run dev`, you should see a 3D demo in `http://localhost:5173/A2`.

### 2. Replace the Dummy Data with Real Ones (3 points)

Please replace this dummy data with real data from the summer movie dataset.

Use async/await to load the data before initializing the 3D scene, ensuring that the scene is populated correctly with the relevant information.

Specifically:
- Pros: What are the advantages of this 3D visualizations? 
- Cons: What are the potential drawbacks or challenges when using this 3D visualizations?
