## Your Tasks in A2:

### 1. Create a Data Dashboard (3 points)

We will create a data dashboard similar to this [demo](https://qianwen.info/my-vis-5609/A2).
As usually, we have created some template code for you to start working with.

- Add the `Line.svelte` and `Scatter.svelte` into `src/lib` folder. Add the lines below to `src/lib/index.ts`
  ```ts
  import Scatter from './Scatter.svelte'
  import Line from './Line.svelte'

  export {Scatter, Line}
  ```
- Copy and Paste the content of `A2.svelte` into `src/routes/A2/+page.svelte` (create the `A2` folder and the `+page.svelte` file yourself).

  After this, run `npm run dev`, you should see a dashboard at `http://localhost:5173/A2`. It will resemble the demo, but without interactions and missing the line in the line chart.

- Complete the following required functions as per the instructions provided in the template code. As usually, comments starting with `tip` indicate the section you work on. I used tip1, tip2, tip3, and tip4 for each of the required functions.
  - 1. Implement click interaction in the scatter plot (0.5 pt)  
  - 2. Add a line to the line chart (0.5 pt)
  - 3. Add brush interaction to the line chart, which will update the scatter plot (1 pt)
  - 4. Dynamically bind data attributes to the x, y, and size channels of the scatter plot using a dropdown selection (1 pt)

### 2.Reflect the design of the dashboard (3 points):

Answer the following questions in your PDF report:
- Why do we use opacity = 0.5 for points in the scatter plot? What would happen if the default transparency of all points were set to 1?
- In the current implementation, all attributes can be bound with the three visual channels, leading to inappropriate encodings (e.g., using the x-axis for the title of 895 movies). Which attribute should be removed from the dropdown list for each channel?
- I use the line chart for the year distribution to showcase how to implement the path generator. But is the line chart the best choice for this use case?


### 3. Conduct Exploratory Datate Analysis (EDA) (4 points)
Using the data dashboard, we will conduct an exploratory analysis to explore *"Which factors influence the ratings of summer movies?"*

- First, please list three potential factors that might influence the rating of summer movies based on your prior knowledge or intuition. 
- Then, use the dashboard to investigate the influence of the three proposed factors.
- If all the three factors do no influence the rating, please consider new ones. At least one of your proposed factors should influence/correlate with the movie rating.

### 4. Submission
Please submit your work as a single PDF on Canvas with the following:
- As usually, the URLs to your demo and your github repo.
- Anwser the three questions in the reflection section
- Document down your EDA: list the three factors you considered, provide screenshots of the visual analytics for each factor, and provide a paragraph for each factor to explain the analysis and your conclusion.
